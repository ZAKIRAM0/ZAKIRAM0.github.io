<h2>eROSITA-RU Tidal Disruption Events with Keck-I/LRIS: Sample Selection, Optical Properties, and Host Galaxy Demographics</h2>
<h3>2025 - UC Berkeley, TRex Team, <strong>Supervisor:</strong> <a href="https://yaoyuhan.github.io/">Yuhan Yao</a></h3>

<p>We present Keck I/LRIS optical spectroscopy and multiwavelength analysis of 70 TDE candidates from eROSITA all-sky surveys, systematically classifying them using BPT/WHAN diagnostics and X-ray/optical luminosity correlations to identify high-confidence (gold) and lower-confidence (silver) TDEs after removing AGN contaminants. We conduct host galaxy analysis, showing in our papers. We identify important spectroscopic diversity including some sources with transient He II λ4686 emission, and rare coronal-line TDEs with [Fe VII–XII] ionization emission.</p>
