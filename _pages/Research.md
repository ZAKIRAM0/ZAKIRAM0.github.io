<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333;">
When a star wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, it can be torn apart by tidal forces, creating a spectacular phenomenon known as a <strong>Tidal Disruption Event (TDE)</strong>. These transients produce luminous flares across X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths, offering a unique opportunity to study black hole accretion and feedback in real time. <br><br>

Recently, I found <strong>coronal TDEs</strong>—events are quite interesting, which exhibit highly ionized iron emission lines ([Fe&nbsp;VII–XIV])—which likely arise when the intense radiation from a TDE photoionizes surrounding circumnuclear gas. <br><br>

Another intriguing subset is partial TDEs, in which the star is only partially stripped during its close encounter, allowing multiple passages and leading to recurrent mass transfer episodes. These events may serve as natural bridges between classical single-passage TDEs and longer-lived accretion phenomena. My undergraduate thesis would focus on the the nature and origins of long-duration high-energy transients, mainly focusing on ULGRB and TDE. <br><br>

I am also exploring the potential connection between <strong>TDEs and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)</strong>, which may originate from the accretion disks formed after partial disruptions or repeated stellar passages. Some recent papers indicate coronal TDEs may trigger QPE, which I do hope to dive in, to figure out  how transient accretion processes evolve and whether they can transition into recurrent QPE-like behavior.

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333;">
TDEs do not occur randomly among galaxies—their hosts tend to be <strong>compact, quiescent, and recently quenched</strong> systems with high stellar densities at their centers. Understanding these host environments provides crucial insight into both <strong>black hole demographics</strong> and <strong>galaxy evolution pathways</strong>. <br><br>

In parallel, I am intrigued by the recently discovered <strong>"Little Red Dots" (LRDs)</strong> revealed by JWST—extremely compact, dusty galaxies that host rapidly accreting black holes at high redshift. I am quite  interested in the physical origins of LRDs, or the possible connection with the early evolutionary analogs of today's TDE host galaxies, connecting <strong>black hole activity</strong> across cosmic time.

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333;">
Beyond galactic nuclei, I am also interested in <strong>compact binary mergers</strong>—especially systems involving neutron stars and black holes, whose possibly produce both gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts such as <em>kilonovae</em> and short gamma-ray bursts. <br><br>

Together, these research directions aim to answer a broader question: <em>How do compact objects—black holes and neutron stars—shape the lifecycle of galaxies through transient, high-energy processes?</em>
