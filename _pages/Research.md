<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333;">
When a star wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, it can be torn apart by tidal forces, creating a spectacular phenomenon known as a <strong>Tidal Disruption Event (TDE)</strong>. These transients produce luminous flares across X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths, offering a unique opportunity to study black hole accretion and feedback in real time. <br><br>

Recently, I found <strong>coronal TDEs</strong>—events are quite interesting, which exhibit highly ionized iron emission lines ([Fe&nbsp;VII–XIV])—which likely arise when the intense radiation from a TDE photoionizes surrounding circumnuclear gas. <br><br>

I am also exploring the potential connection between <strong>TDEs and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)</strong>, which may originate from the accretion disks formed after partial disruptions or repeated stellar passages. Some recent papers indicate coronal TDEs may trigger QPE, which I do hope to dive in, to figure out  how transient accretion processes evolve and whether they can transition into recurrent QPE-like behavior.

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333;">
TDEs do not occur randomly among galaxies—their hosts tend to be <strong>compact, quiescent, and recently quenched</strong> systems with high stellar densities at their centers. Understanding these host environments provides crucial insight into both <strong>black hole demographics</strong> and <strong>galaxy evolution pathways</strong>. <br><br>

In parallel, I am intrigued by the recently discovered <strong>"Little Red Dots" (LRDs)</strong> revealed by JWST—extremely compact, dusty galaxies that host rapidly accreting black holes at high redshift. I am quite  interested in the physical origins of LRDs, or the possible connection with the early evolutionary analogs of today's TDE host galaxies, connecting <strong>black hole activity</strong> across cosmic time.

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4; color: #333;">
Beyond galactic nuclei, I am also interested in <strong>compact binary mergers</strong>—especially systems involving neutron stars and black holes, whose possibly produce both gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts such as <em>kilonovae</em> and short gamma-ray bursts. <br><br>

Together, these research directions aim to answer a broader question: <em>How do compact objects—black holes and neutron stars—shape the lifecycle of galaxies through transient, high-energy processes?</em>
