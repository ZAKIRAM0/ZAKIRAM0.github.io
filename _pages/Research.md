**Background:** When a star wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, it can be torn apart by tidal forces, creating a spectacular astronomical phenomenon called a <strong>Tidal Disruption Event (TDE)</strong>. These rare transients produce bright flares in X-rays and optical wavelengths, offering unique windows into the properties of otherwise dormant black holes and their immediate environments. Understanding which types of galaxies host TDEs—and why—is crucial for constraining black hole demographics and galaxy evolution.
